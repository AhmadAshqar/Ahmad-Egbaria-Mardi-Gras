                            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New
                                Orleans. Celebrations are
                                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                                Wednesday (the start of lent in
                                the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season
                                actually begins on King’s Day
                                (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday.
                            <p>
                                Club, or
                                Krewe, balls start soon after,
                                though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old
                                families and their courts
                                consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage
                                parades. As Fat Tuesday gets nearer,
                                the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                                permitting); many days have several
                                large parades.

                                The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of
                                the Mardi Gras season. In the
                                final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
                                including parades and balls (some of
                                them masquerade balls).

                                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow
                                the same parade schedule and route
                                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                                earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and
                                the Krewe of Proteus.

                            <p class="">
                                Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large
                                parades and events (often featuring
                                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the
                                Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a
                                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the
                                crowds. The most common throws are
                                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small
                                inexpensive toys. Major krewes
                                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major
                                parades originate in the Uptown and
                                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
                                upriver side of the French
                                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take
                                place downtown in the Faubourg
                                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day
                                traditionally concludes with the
                                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                                The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
                                Mississippi River in what is now
                                lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                                men celebrated it as part of an
                                observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in
                                New Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                                account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                                (including cross-dressing).

                                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were
                                quickly renewed whenever such
                                restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                                Today when two Mardi Gras Indian tribes pass one another, you will see a living theater
                                of
                                art
                                and culture. Each tribe's style and dress is on display in a friendly but competitive
                                manner.
                                They compare one another's art and craftsmanship.</p>

                            <p>
                                The Big Chiefs of two different tribes start with a song/chant, ceremonial dance, and
                                threatening challenge to "Humba". The Big Chief's demand that the other Chief bows and
                                pays
                                respect. The retort is a whoop and equally impressive song and war dance with the reply,
                                "Me
                                no

                                LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as
                                the Mayor of New Orleans,
                                Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                                Before becoming mayor, Cantrell
                                represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.</p>

                            <p>
                                Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position
                                in the city's history. Once
                                in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating
                                a strategic plan to address
                                families in crisis in the city. </p>

                            <p>
                                Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council,
                                tasked with finding solutions to
                                violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the
                                city for city use, Cantrell has
                                focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
                                transportation, public parks, and green
                                spaces.As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a
                                lawsuit against four opioid
                                manufacturers and distributors.
